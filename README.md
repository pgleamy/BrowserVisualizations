# Browser Visualizations
A collection of JavaScript artistic visualizations that I've made. Each is contained in a single .html file.

Each visualization is different and most are interactive in some way, but some are not. To run them just copy the code to any whatevername.html file and then double click to run it in your browswer window. Many of the visualizations are better if you select the full screen option for your browser.
