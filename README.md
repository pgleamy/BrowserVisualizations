# Browser Visualizations
A collection of JavaScript artistic visualizations that I've made. Each is contained in a single .html file.

I created this repository because X.com breaks my code when I cut and paste it into a post by forcefully adding hyperlinks. I needed a way to share these reliably so people aren't frustrated when they try to run them and they don't work (because X.com broke my code!).

Each visualization is different and most are interactive in some way, but some are not. To run them just copy the code to any whatevername.html file and then double click to run it in your browswer window. Many of the visualizations are better if you select the full screen option for your browser.
