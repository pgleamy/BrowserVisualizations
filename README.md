# Browser Visualizations
A collection of JavaScript artistic visualizations that I've made. Each is contained in a single .html file. Each visualization is different and most are interactive in some way, but some are not. Try moving the mouse or scroll wheel, or clicking and dragging. To run them just copy to your computer and then double click to run it in your browser. Many of the visualizations are better if you select the full screen option for your browser. 

I have a bunch of these I've made, but most are not that great. So I'll just add the interesting ones here from time to time.
