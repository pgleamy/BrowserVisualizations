 <p>Javascript visualizations and games I've made. Browser full screen mode recommended. My favorite visualization is the Solar System. The games are simple other than the new Asteroids clone. That one I created using GPT-4o to test it's coding abilities. I don't believe an earlier model would have been able to do it to this level of precision. It was about 6 hours of interation and is almost 700 lines of JavaScript code. All of these are created in collaboration with artificial intelligence coding tools. I'll add to this over time.</p>
